<h1>SECURITY & ACCESS MECHANISM</h1>
<h2>SECURITY</h2>
<p>Protection and security requires that computer resources such as CPU, softwares, memory etc. are protected. This extends to the operating system as well as the data in the system. This can be done by ensuring integrity, confidentiality and availability in the operating system. 
The system must be protect against unauthorized access, viruses, worms etc.Protection and Security Methods The different methods that may provide protect and security for different computer systems are - Authentication This deals with identifying each user in the system and making sure they are who they claim to be. The operating system makes sure that all the users are authenticated before they access the system. The different ways to make sure that the users are authentic are: Username/ Password Each user has a distinct username and password combination and they need to enter it correctly before they can access the system. User Key/ User Card The users need to punch a card into the card slot or use they individual key on a keypad to access the system. User Attribute Identification Different user attribute identifications that can be used are fingerprint, eye retina etc. These are unique for each user and are compared with the existing samples in the database. The user can only access the system if there is a match. 
One Time Password These passwords provide a lot of security for authentication purposes. A one time password can be generated exclusively for a login every time a user wants to enter the system. It cannot be used more than once. The various ways a one time password can be implemented are - Random Numbers The system can ask for numbers that correspond to alphabets that are pre arranged. This combination can be changed each time a login is required. Secret Key A hardware device can create a secret key related to the user id for login. This key can change each time.
</p>
<h2>ACCESS MECHANISM</h2>
<p>Access control for an operating system determines how the operating system implements accesses to system resources by satisfying the security objectives of integrity, availability, and secrecy. Such a mechanism authorizes subjects (e.g., processes and users) to perform certain operations (e.g., read, write) on objects and resources of the OS (e.g., files, sockets).<br>Operating system is the main software between the users and the computing system resources that manage tasks and programs. 
Resources may include files, sockets, CPU, memory, disks, timers, network, etc. System administrators, developers, regular users, guests, and even hackers could be the users of the computing system.</p>
