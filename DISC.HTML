<h1>DISC SCHEDULING</h1>
<p>The Scheduling is used for Divide the Total Time of the CPU between the Number or Processes So that the Processes can execute Concurrently at a Single Time. For Sharing the Time or For Dividing the Total Time of the CPU, the CPU uses the following the Scheduling Techniques.
<br>
1/ First Come First Serve (FCFS) : In this Operating System Creates a Queue which contains the Sequence Order in which they are to be Executed and the Sequence in which the CPU will Execute the Process. In this all the Jobs are performed according to their Sequence Order as they have entered. In this the Job which had Requested first will firstly performed by the CPU.
<br>
2/ Shortest Seek Time First (SSTF) : In this Technique The Operating System will Search for the Shortest time means this will search which job will takes a Less Time of CPU for Running. And After Examining all the jobs, all the Jobs are Organized into the Priority Order.
<br>
3/ Scan Scheduling: This approach works like an elevator . It scans down towards the nearest end and then when it hits the bottom it scans up servicing the requests that it didn't get going down.</p>
